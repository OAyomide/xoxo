# Say what??
Yeah. I feel I should move on to using a full framework. I am having issues developing faster and its already become a drag.

Here are (some of) the issues I was facing:
 1. Expiring tokens.
 2. Switching to another DB
 3. CORS issues (I solved this though)


Overall, it was becoming slow to do what I really want to do. And since the initial aim of starting without any framework was to learn about using the http library in Go, I feel I already achieved my aim and should move on.

So yeah, deprecating this branch.
